# PawsNet 🐾
CNN-based image classification system for cats and dogs 

**PawsNet** is a convolutional neural network (CNN)–based image classification system
designed to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## 🔍 Overview
The model is trained on labeled image data and uses deep learning techniques
to learn visual patterns that differentiate cats and dogs with high accuracy.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 🚀 Features
- Binary image classification (Cat vs Dog)
- CNN architecture for feature extraction
- Scalable and extendable to other animal classes

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with data augmentation
- Add a web interface for real-time predictions
- Extend to multi-class animal classification

## 📂 Dataset
- The model is trained on the Cats vs Dogs image dataset sourced from Kaggle.
- The dataset contains labeled images of cats and dogs
- Images are organized into separate class folders
- The dataset was downloaded using the Kaggle API
